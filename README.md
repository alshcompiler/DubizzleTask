# DubizzleTask

**Install:** Use pod install in case you faced an issue.

**Notes**

1- The app shows only one item in each table view cell because the API returns only an item in the imageURL array, but in case it returns more than one item, a      pager view will appear magically to swipe between images.

2-  The app was implemented using VIPER design pattern as recommended.

3- Unit tests and UI tests were implemented (unit tests are not a lot since the task is small).

4- Implemented an image caching framework and itegrated it with the project.

5- Couldn't make the Objective-C screen since i had to choose between maintaining VIPER and making the Objective-C screen due to the lake of time and i choose VIPER
